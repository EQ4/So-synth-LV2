SO-666 v.1.0 by 50m30n3 2009
LV2 port by Jeremy Salwen 2010

SO-666 is a feedback based drone synthesizer building upon the SO-KL5 synth.
It creates haunting cacophonic howls and drones.
It's a bit hard to play but making good use of the modwheel will help keep the
sound in control.

You will need an LV2 synth host to run this plugin. The default midichannel
is zero.

All synthesis parameters can be edited using MIDI CC messages.

Parameter list:
CC#1	-	Feedback (mod wheel)
CC#7	-	Volume
CC#71	-	Filter Resonance
CC#74	-	Filter Cutoff

To compile the code you need the lv2 core development files.
