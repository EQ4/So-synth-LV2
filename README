LV2 ports by Jeremy Salwen 2010

*******SO-666 v.1.0 by 50m30n3 2009*******

SO-666 is a feedback based drone synthesizer building upon the SO-KL5 synth.
It creates haunting cacophonic howls and drones.
It's a bit hard to play but making good use of the modwheel will help keep the
sound in control.

All synthesis parameters can be edited using MIDI CC messages.

Parameter list:
CC#1	-	Feedback (mod wheel)
CC#7	-	Volume
CC#71	-	Filter Resonance
CC#74	-	Filter Cutoff

To compile the code you need the ALSA and Jack developement files.

*******SO-KL5 v.1.1 by 50m30n3 2010*******

SO-KL5 is a string based "piano" synthezizer. The strings are
modeled using the Karplus-Strong String simulation method.

Parameter list:
CC#1	-	Sustain
CC#7	-	Volume
CC#64	-	Sustain
CC#71	-	Filter Resonance
CC#74	-	Filter Cutoff

Sustain can be controlled by CC#1 (Mod Wheel) and CC#64 (Sustain) to make
control easier for people without a sustain pedal.

*******SO-404 v.1.0 by 50m30n3 2009*******

SO-404 is a simple bass synthesizer using 1 oscillator and 1 filter.
The oscillator is a simple saw wave oscillator and the filter is a simple
resonant lowpass filter. You know, like that other very good and famous synth
with a similar name. Just not as good and famous.

All synthesis parameters can be edited using MIDI CC messages.

Parameter list:
CC#7	-	Volume
CC#65	-	Portamento time
CC#71	-	Filter Resonance
CC#72	-	Release time
CC#74	-	Filter Cutoff
CC#79	-	Filter Envelope

If two notes are played together the pitch will slide according to the
portamento time. Filter cutoff and note volume are influenced by the MIDI
note velocity.
